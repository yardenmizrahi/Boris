# Parallel Implementation of Proximity Criteria
Final project
Course 10324, Parallel and Distributed Computation
2023 Fall Semester

A set of N points is placed in two-dimensional plane. Coordinates (x, y) of each point P are defined as follows:

x = ((x2 – x1) / 2 ) * sin (t*π /2) + (x2 + x1) / 2) 
y = a*x + b

where (x1, x2, a, b) are constant parameters predefined for each point P.

Problem Definition

We will say that some point P from the set satisfies a Proximity Criteria if there exist at least K points in the set with a distance from the point P less than a given value D.
Given a value of parameter t, we want to find if there exist at least 3 points that satisfies the Proximity Criteria 

Requirements

•	Perform checks for Proximity Criteria for tCount + 1 values of  t:
 t = 2 * i / tCount  - 1,          i = 0,  1,  2,  3, …,  tCount
		where tCount is a given integer number.
•	For each value of t find if there is three points that satisfy the Proximity Criteria. If such three points are found – don't continue evaluation for this specific value of t. 
•	The input file input.txt initially is known for one process only. The results must be written to the file output.txt by the same process. 
•	The computation time of the parallel program must be faster than sequential solution. 
•	Be ready to demonstrate your solution running on VLAB (two computers from different pools when using MPI)
•	No code sharing between students is allowed. Each part of code, if any, which was incorporated into your project must be referenced according to the academic rules.  
•	Be able to explain each line of the project code, including those that were reused from any source. 
•	The project that is not created properly (missing files, build or run errors) will not be accepted


Input data and Output Result of the project

The input file contains N in the first line - the number of point in the set, K – minimal number of points to satisfy the Proximity Criteria, distance D  and TCount. T
he next N lines contain parameters for every point in the set. One or more blanks are between the numbers in a file.
Input.txt
N   K   D   TCount
id   x1    x2    a    b
id   x1    x2    a    b
id   x1    x2    a    b
…
id   x1    x2    a    b

For example
4      2      1.23     100
0    2.2     1.2      2       45.07
1    -1       26.2    4,4    -3.3
2    -43.3   12.2   4.7     20
3    11.0    -6.6    12.5   23. 

Output.txt
The output file contains information about results found for points that satisfies the Proximity Criteria. 
•	For each t that 3 points satisfying the Proximity Criteria were found, it contains a line with the parameter t and ID of these 3 points
Points  pointID1, pointID2, pointID3 satisfy Proximity Criteria at t = t1 
Points  pointID4, pointID5, pointID6 satisfy Proximity Criteria at t = t2
Points  pointID7, pointID8, pointID9 satisfy Proximity Criteria at t = t3

•	In case that the points were not found for any t, the program outputs:
Number of points
